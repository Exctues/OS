For increasing perfomance:
Just sort the input file and we get increasing hit/miss ration because if there is duplicate
then we won't need to delete something(miss)
and put new value instead because element(page) we try to find already there.

For decreasing perfomance:
We can shuffle input such that there's no same elements next to each other.
